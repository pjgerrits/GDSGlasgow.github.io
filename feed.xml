Interpreting the spatial information tying this data to real-world locations is a key challenge. Modern advancements in AI and machine learning might provide a promising solution – but we first need to establish just how well these models really understand spatial information. To answer this, we will explore the ambiguities and complexities of geospatial language, and the limitations of modern AI models.</p> <h4 id="stubborn-minorities-in-cities">“Stubborn” Minorities in Cities</h4> <p><strong>Dr Guy Solomon (Research Associate, University of Glasgow)</strong> It is often assumed that the “majority rules”, but is this actually the case? In many instances, the way a system works is determined by a small, inflexible group (sometimes called a “stubborn minority”) who—for various reasons—may not (or, perhaps, cannot) adapt. This talk outlines what is meant by this term, considers examples of “stubborn minorities” in cities, and discusses why this matters for everyone.</p>]]></content><author><name>Piet Gerrits</name></author><category term="conference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join us for a Pint of Science with Dr Ian Turton, Joe Shingleton and Dr Guy Solomon!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Defence and Security</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DSO-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Defence and Security"/><published>2024-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DSO-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DSO-video/"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QB1iz4Syk_k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Ana Basiri and Joseph Shingleton discuss their work on defence and security. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Petrus Gerrits talks about historical population modelling in Turkey and Bulgaria</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/PG-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Petrus Gerrits talks about historical population modelling in Turkey and Bulgaria"/><published>2024-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/PG-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/PG-video/"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOuUdmfqXps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Petrus Gerrits on historical population modelling. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dominick Sutton on missing data mechanisms</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DS-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dominick Sutton on missing data mechanisms"/><published>2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DS-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/DS-video/"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQiqRb3zSyg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Dominick Sutton talks about how missing data happens. </div> <p>Dominick Sutton is a PhD candidate in the Geospatial Data Science unit. He is researching missing data and how spatial information can be used to improve the accuracy of techniques used to replace the missing values. Missing data is a serious issue for all users of data, including those working in biomedical research, climate change, business, financial and economic analytics. It is a particular problem for users of big data and seriously limits the applicability of their models, not least because it can introduce new forms of data bias that may be especially hard to detect and address.</p> <p>If missing data is present in a dataset it can results in less accurate analysis results and assessment of uncertainty, even if measures are taken to allow for these omissions. This can seriously affect the value of subsequent data uses and limits the value of big data despite its apparent large scale. Prior to undertaking his PhD Dominick was Chief Data Officer of a multinational corporation and before that Chief Economist of a small investment bank. He has Masters’ degrees in Economics, Business Administration and Data Analytics and is a Fellow and Graduate Statistician of the Royal Statistical Society.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Safer End of Engineered Life</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/SEEL-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safer End of Engineered Life"/><published>2024-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/SEEL-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2024/SEEL-video/"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCkBwFPPi_c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> Ana Basiri and Matt Johnston talk about their work in relation to digital inheritance and the climate impact of data. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="video"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LBS 2023</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/LBS-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LBS 2023"/><published>2023-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/LBS-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/LBS-2023/"><![CDATA[<p>Attending conferences is one of the most crucial milestones in our academic journey as a PhD student. It means not only gaining knowledge but also following the most up-to-date research in the field, interacting with experienced academics, and getting the opportunity to share our research with a wide range of experts and receive their opinions to improve our research.</p> <p>For the last two years, I have had the chance to attend the ‘Location Based Services’ conference held in Munich in 2022 and in Ghent in 2023. During this time, I had the opportunity to follow the latest developments in location-based services. Thanks to this valuable annual event, we meet the leading names in this field. Organised by Haosheng Huang and Nico Van de Weghe from Ghent University this year, this conference is a meeting point that brings together academics from around the world every year.</p> <p>At the conference, interesting and valuable sessions were held in the ‘Location Based Services’ field, such as ‘LBS and Cycling,’ ‘GeoAI, Urban and Mobility Analytics,’ ‘User Experience, Privacy,’ ‘Innovative LBS Applications,’ ‘User Studies and Data Analysis,’ ‘Wayfinding and Navigation,’ and ‘Positioning and Tracking.’ The sessions offered a broad perspective covering various aspects of this field. In particular, GeoAI sessions attracted attention with the many studies and exciting projects presented in these sessions. GeoAI discusses how artificial intelligence technologies can be used to develop location-based services and innovations in this field. This session became one of the conference’s highlights with its impressive presentations.</p> <p>I had the chance to present our research at this conference. My presentation was titled ‘The Importance of Communication with Missing Data with Colours of Map for Decision-Making.’ In this presentation, I discussed the importance of communication with missing data and how this communication can be perceived through map colours. The valuable suggestions and feedback I received regarding my research will guide me in the further stages of my research.</p> <p>Such events are excellent opportunities for students like me to follow new developments in our field, meet experts, and develop our research further!</p>]]></content><author><name>Merve Polat Kayali</name></author><category term="conference"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[attending LBS 2023]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SIGSPATIAL 2023</title><link href="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/SIGSPATIAL-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SIGSPATIAL 2023"/><published>2023-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/SIGSPATIAL-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gdsglasgow.github.io/blog/2023/SIGSPATIAL-2023/"><![CDATA[<p>Attending SIGSPATIAL 2023 was an enriching journey!
