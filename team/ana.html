However, the financial cost associated with creating and updating 3D maps using the current state-of-the-art methods such as laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry are prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, researchers have proposed using GNSS signals to create 3D maps. This paper advances that family of methods by proposing and implementing a novel technique that avoids the difficult step of directly classifying GNSS signals into line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight classes by utilising edge detection techniques adapted from computer vision. This prevents classification biases and increases the range of environments in which GNSS-based 3D mapping methods can be accurately deployed. Being based on the patterns of blockage and attenuation of GNSS signals that are freely and globally available to receive by many mobile phones, makes the proposed technique a free, scalable and accessible solution. This paper also identifies some key indicators affecting data collection scalability and efficiency of the 3D mapping solution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten292249" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Participatory Approach to Develop Missing Geospatial Data Visualisation</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/merve">Merve Polat Kayali</a>, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In European Cartographic Conference – EuroCarto 2022</em>, Sep 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Abstract available from publisher’s website.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten273653" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Classification of Missing Geospatial Data from Structure and Mechanism Perspective</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/merve">Merve Polat Kayali</a>, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 30th Annual Geographical Information Science Research UK (GISRUK)</em>, Apr 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Data-centric science, data-empowered society, and policymaking based on data can suffer from flawed conclusions if data are representative, biased, or unavailable.

Distinguishing the different types of missingness help us to develop and implement new imputation approaches, sampling strategies and output uncertainty quantification.

We found that working-age male participants have a larger geographic extent of entries compared to their female counterparts. However, this once again varied significantly by the age groups.

Given the geography of congested roads, availability of required infrastructure and cost of transportation in cities, promoting active travel, including cycling, can be a good solution for commuting within built environments. Having a better understanding of the key drivers that may influence bike ridership can help with designing cities that accommodate cyclists? needs for healthier citizens. This paper examines the built environment features that may affect commuting cyclists. We respectively employ Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) regression and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for 136 Intermediate Zones of the city of Glasgow, UK. The results of GWR show that the significant local variation in green areas suggests that even though the global regression showed a negative association between the greenness and commute cycling, over half of the IZ areas had a strong positive association with the green areas. Building height and Public Transport Availability Index show geographic patterns where the residuals are fairly stationary across the study area with some clusters of high residuals. Performance wise, the results from GWR provided an R2 of 0.73 which was higher than OLS at 0.3. Our results can provide insights into how to use crowdsourced cycling data when there are spatially and temporally limited resources available.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten243700" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">3D map creation using crowdsourced GNSS data</div> <div class="author"> Terence Lines, and <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computers, Environment and Urban Systems</em>, Sep 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>3D maps are increasingly useful for many applications such as drone navigation, emergency services, and urban planning. However, creating 3D maps and keeping them up-to-date using existing technologies, such as laser scanners, is expensive. This paper proposes and implements a novel approach to generate 2.5D (otherwise known as 3D level-of-detail (LOD) 1) maps for free using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which are globally available and are blocked only by obstacles between the satellites and the receivers. This enables us to find the patterns of GNSS signal availability and create 3D maps. The paper applies algorithms to GNSS signal strength patterns based on a boot-strapped technique that iteratively trains the signal classifiers while generating the map. Results of the proposed technique demonstrate the ability to create 3D maps using automatically processed GNSS data. The results show that the third dimension, i.e. height of the buildings, can be estimated with below 5 metre accuracy, which is the benchmark recommended by the CityGML standard.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten250459" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predictably unpredictable</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Navigation</em>, Jul 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>No abstract available.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten250460" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effectiveness modelling of digital contact-tracing solutions for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic</div> <div class="author"> Viktoriia Shubina, Aleksandr Ometov, <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Many countries have been working towards developing suitable digital contact-tracing apps to allow the measurement of the physical distance between citizens and to alert them when contact with an infected individual has occurred. However, the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps has faced several challenges so far, including interoperability between mobile devices and users? privacy concerns. There is a need to reach a trade-off between the achievable technical performance of new technology, false-positive rates, and social and behavioural factors. This paper reviews a wide range of factors and classifies them into three categories of technical, epidemiological and social ones, and incorporates these into a compact mathematical model. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing apps based on received signal strength measurements. The results highlight the limitations, potential and challenges of the adoption of digital contact-tracing apps.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten250461" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Identifying urban functional areas and their dynamic changes in Beijing: using multiyear transit smart card data</div> <div class="author"> Zijia Wang, Haixu Liu, Yadi Zhu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the distribution and evolution of a city’s urban functional areas over different periods of time. Although the smart card automated fare collection system is already widely used, few studies have used smart card data to infer information about changes in urban functional areas, particularly in developing countries. Thus, this research aims to delineate the dynamic changes that have occurred in urban functional areas based on passengers’ travel patterns, using Beijing as a case study. We established a Bayesian framework and applied a Gaussian mixture model derived from transit smart card data in order to gain insight into passengers’ travel patterns at station level and then identify the dynamic changes in their corresponding urban functional areas. Our results show that Beijing can be clustered into five different functional areas based on the analysis of corresponding transit station functions: multimodal interchange hub and leisure area; residential area; employment area; mixed but mainly residential area; and mixed residential and employment area. In addition, we found that urban functional areas have experienced slight changes between 2014 and 2017. The findings can be used to inform urban planning strategies designed to tackle urban spatial structure issues, as well as guiding future policy evaluation of urban landscape pattern use.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten228989" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A contextual hybrid model for vessel movement prediction</div> <div class="author"> Saeed Mehri, Ali Asghar Alesheikh, and <a href="/team/ana">Ana Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Access</em>, Mar 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Predicting the movement of the vessels can significantly improve the management of safety. While the movement can be a function of geographic contexts, the current systems and methods rarely incorporate contextual information into the analysis. This paper initially proposes a novel context-aware trajectories? simplification method to embed the effects of geographic context which guarantees the logical consistency of the compressed trajectories, and further suggests a hybrid method that is built upon a curvilinear model and deep neural networks. The proposed method employs contextual information to check the logical consistency of the curvilinear method and then, constructs a Context-aware Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) network that can take into account contextual variables, such as the vessel types. The proposed method can enhance the prediction accuracy while maintaining the logical consistency, through a recursive feedback loop. The implementations of the proposed approach on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset, from the eastern coast of the United States of America which was collected, from November to December 2017, demonstrates the effectiveness and better compression, i.e. 80% compression ratio while maintaining the logical consistency. The estimated compressed trajectories are 23% more similar to their original trajectories compared to currently used simplification methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the implemented hybrid method is 15.68% higher than the ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which is currently used by various maritime systems and applications, including collision avoidance, vessel route planning, and anomaly detection systems</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten217556" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Inclusivity and diversity of navigation services</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Navigation</em>, Mar 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Our car seats, watch straps, seatbelts, and gym equipment are all adjustable because of the ?jaggedness principle?, which basically says that nobody is average.

Science and technology always try to push the boundaries and ?improve?; improving the quality of our lives or improving the quality of technologies. We, as researchers in the area of navigation, are no exception; we want to improve the quality of navigation services. And there are many ways to do so, and challenges and limitations to those attempts. Some researchers look to improve the accuracy, the reliability, the integrity through different approaches. Some try to reduce or model noise, some try to minimise human error, and some use novel techniques and algorithms for better prediction. Of course, when ?our horses cannot go any faster? and there is not much space for improvement for a certain technology or service, researchers may come up with a completely new solution, such as an automobile. Almost all new technologies go through the same exploration period; at the beginning, we want to see how and if it works so we try simple tasks, but then we become more ambitious (or greedier!) and so we introduce it to more difficult challenges until it hits the breaking point. At this point, curious researchers and inventors try to push the boundaries and make the technology better, and if improvement is not possible, they build (invent) a new solution. But what is the ?quality? that many of us want to improve?

However, positioning and localization inside buildings and in indoor spaces, where users spend most of their time and where the signals of the most widely-used positioning system, i.e. Global Navigation Satellite Systems such as GPS (Global Positioning System), are not available, can be challenging. In this regard, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), e.g. Wi-Fi, can be used for positioning purposes by using a WLAN-enabled device, e.g. a smartphone, to measure and match the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of a signal broadcast by an access point. The challenges of this approach are that accurate maps of RSS are required, and that measuring RSS can be affected by many factors, including the dynamics of the environment and the orientation and type of a device. This paper provides a path-loss model to produce RSS maps automatically from floor plans and introduces an agent-based simulation approach to investigate different positioning methods. This provides a pathway to reduce the time and effort associated with WLAN positioning research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten221724" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Signal Attenuation Modelling in WLAN Positioning</div> <div class="author"> Terry Lines, and <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In XXXV Finnish URSI Convention on Radio Science</em>, Oct 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), as the most widely used indoor positioning technology, can localise users by measuring the Received Signal Strength (RSS) from multiple Access Points (AP). The challenges of this approach are that measuring RSS can be easily affected by several parameters, including how the users hold the device, e.g. device orientation, and that accurate maps of RSS are required. This paper (A) introduces a bell-curve model of signal attenuation from orientation, allowing more accurate RSS measurement, and (B) identifies collinearity issues with a path-loss model used to automatically create RSS maps, suggesting a simpler and more robust alternative.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten250462" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Crowdsourced geospatial data quality: challenges and future directions</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a>, Muki Haklay, Giles Foody, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

For this reason, they have not yet found a prominent position in people?s everyday lives. Reliability and availability of indoor positioning technologies, the availability of up-to-date indoor maps, and privacy concerns associated with location data are some of the biggest challenges to their development. If these challenges were solved, or at least minimized, there would be more penetration into the user market. This paper studies the requirements of LBS applications, through a survey conducted by the authors, identifies the current challenges of indoor LBS, and reviews the available solutions that address the most important challenge, that of providing seamless indoor/outdoor positioning. The paper also looks at the potential of emerging solutions and the technologies that may help to handle this challenge.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten221119" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quality assessment of OpenStreetMap data using trajectory mining</div> <div class="author"> <a href="/team/ana">Anahid Basiri</a>, Mike Jackson, Pouria Amirian, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

Many contributors to OSM have not been trained in geography or surveying and consequently their contributions, including geometry and attribute data inserts, deletions, and updates, can be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, or vague. There are some mechanisms and applications dedicated to discovering bugs and errors in OSM data. Such systems can remove errors through user-checks and applying predefined rules but they need an extra control process to check the real-world validity of suspected errors and bugs. This paper focuses on finding bugs and errors based on patterns and rules extracted from the tracking data of users. The underlying idea is that certain characteristics of user trajectories are directly linked to the type of feature. Using such rules, some sets of potential bugs and errors can be identified and stored for further investigations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright The Geospatial Data Science Group at The University of Glasgow 2025.
